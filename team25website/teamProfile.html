										</br> Learning Style Test</br></br><font size ="4">
										<p>Auditory/Tactile</br> Auditory: 35% / Visual: 30% /
										Tactile: 35%</br></br>

											If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and
											listening. You understand and remember things you have
											heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you
											have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than
											written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because
											you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it. As an
											auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or
											others if you become bored. People may think you are not
											paying attention, even though you may be hearing and
											understanding everything being said.</br></br> If you are
											a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You
											understand and remember things through physical movement.
											You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move,
											build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn
											better when some type of physical activity is involved.
											You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often
											speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have
											difficulty sitting still. As a tactile learner, you like
											to take things apart and put things together, and you tend
											to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become
											bored.</p></font>
